# Static Instagram Clone using HTML and CSS
Welcome to my Instagram clone project! This is a static web page created using HTML and CSS to replicate the visual design of Instagram. While the clone is currently static and not fully responsive, it showcases the basic layout and styling inspired by the popular social media platform.
